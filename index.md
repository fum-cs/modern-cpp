Welcome to the advanced programming course which is devoted to Modern C++, where you will learn the main features and best practices of C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20. This course is designed for programmers who are already familiar with traditional C++ language and want to update their skills with the latest standards.
For those students that are not familiar with C++, but have experinces with Python, another web site, named [C++ for Python](https://fum-cs.github.io/cpp4python) prorammers is prepared.

Here, you will learn how to write simpler, safer, more elegant, and more efficient code with modern C++. You will also learn how to use the C++ Standard Library and its containers, algorithms, smart pointers, strings, and more.
This course consists of several chapters, each covering a specific topic or feature of modern C++. Each chapter contains a lot of code examples and exercises to help you understand and practice the concepts. You can find the source code on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fum-cs/modern-cpp/) of this course. I hope you enjoy this course and learn a lot from it.

I should also mention that the original material of this course was from [Richard Spencer's web site](https://learnmoderncpp.com/). He is a computer science student and a C++ tutor who created this course as a way to share his knowledge and passion for modern C++. I have forked his repository and modified it to suit my own needs and preferences. I would like to thank him for his great work and generosity.
